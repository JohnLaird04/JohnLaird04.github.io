# About Me

![](/assets/img/blog/aboutMe.jpeg){:.lead width="1110" loading="lazy"}
I am currently living in Salt Lake City, Utah, and I am 
persuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Utah.
When I am not coding, you will find me playing soccer or ultimate
frisbee, hiking, or snowboarding.

Since I was young I have always enjoyed being around computers.
I loved playing video games as a kid, but as I grew up I became
more and more fascinated with the computer itself. I became 
obsessed with building computers and optimizing their performance
through overclocking and undervolting. Now, after discovering Python
in high school, I love coding and learning how to optimize the 
software computers run.
